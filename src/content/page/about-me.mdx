I am a senior software engineer originally hailing from southern Appalachia in
the United States. 

My interests lie in the area between traditional software engineering and
machine learning, where I enjoy building systems and software which use data and
AI at their core. I take particular satisfaction in designing systems which are
reliable, composable, and easily maintained.

While I am most interested in solving cross-cutting problems, I have a
particular affinity for Python along with functional programming languages like
Scala and Haskell. I am also a big proponent of free and open-source software,
examples of which you can find on my [GitHub
profile](https://github.com/dorranh).

My professional experience has spanned a wide range of business domains, having
recently spent the better part of five years consulting for clients building
data and ML products in the computer vision, pharmaceutical, energy, and
healthcare sectors. My academic background is in geophysics and physical
geography, where I built numerical and statistical models of the Earth's
interior.
